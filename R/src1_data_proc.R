# LSOA centroids - what the next 3 lines do is commented in more detail below.  An LSOA is a geographical description of areas "lower super output area" in England - there are around n,000 of these, with on average 1500 people.  This in the end produces a dataframe

Even the help(raster) doesnt explain to me what raster does
